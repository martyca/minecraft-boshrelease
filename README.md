You must have a BOSH Director and have uploaded stemcells to it. Our examples assume the [BOSH CLI v2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli).

Follow the instructions to install BOSH Lite: <https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite>;
upload the Cloud Config.

Clone the minecraft repository:

```bash
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/martyca/minecraft-boshrelease.git
cd minecraft-boshrelease

```bash
bosh -e vbox upload-release https://github.com/martyca/minecraft-boshrelease.git
